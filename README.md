# Life Game Project

This project is the final assignment for the Fall 2023 Programming Project course. It implements Conway's Game of Life, a zero-player game and cellular automaton devised by John Conway in 1970.

## Project Structure
The source code is written in three files: `main.c`, `conway.h`, and `conway.c`.

`main.c`: Contains the user interaction part.

`conway.h`: Contains the declaration of the Conway functions.

`conway.c`: Contains the implementation of functions.

## Getting Started

To run the program, clone the repository and compile `main.c` using a C compiler. You can then execute the compiled binary to start the Game of Life simulation.

## Viewing Design Document
The detailed design of this project is documented in the `design_document.md` file. You can refer to this file for a comprehensive understanding of the project's design and implementation details.



## References

The scaffold framework for this project was provided by the teaching assistant. My contribution includes implementing the core functionality of the game and additional features.
